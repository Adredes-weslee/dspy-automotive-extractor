- **Substantial gains**: Average improvement of +4.0% across all strategies
- **Range**: From +2.0% (Self-Refine) to +8.66% (Contrastive CoT)
- **New champion**: Contrastive CoT + Reasoning achieves 51.33%

#### üéØ **Strategy Performance Patterns - SURPRISING INSIGHTS**
- **Complex strategies benefit MORE**: Contrastive CoT shows largest improvement

- **Reasoning amplifies sophistication**: Advanced prompting + reasoning = best results
- **Consistent baseline**: Most strategies without reasoning perform similarly (~42-43%)

#### üß† **Theoretical Validation**
- **Contrastive learning**: Positive/negative examples create strongest reasoning patterns
- **Error prevention**: Explicit bad examples teach avoidance patterns
- **Decision boundaries**: Contrasting cases clarify extraction logic

## üß† Theoretical Analysis

### Why Contrastive CoT Dominates

#### 1. **Explicit Error Prevention**
```
Good Example: "2023 Tesla Model Y" ‚Üí Make=Tesla, Model=Model Y, Year=2023
Bad Example: "65 mph with 50,000 miles" ‚Üí Make=UNKNOWN (not speed/mileage)
```
- **Negative examples** teach what NOT to extract
- **Boundary clarification** between relevant/irrelevant numbers
- **Pattern recognition** enhanced by contrasting cases

#### 2. **Robust Reasoning Patterns**
- **Contrastive learning** creates more robust decision boundaries
- **Error correction** explicitly modeled in reasoning chains
- **Confidence calibration** improved through example comparison

#### 3. **Bootstrap Enhancement**
- **Quality demonstrations** include both positive and negative patterns
- **Richer training signal** from contrasting examples
- **Better generalization** to edge cases

### Why Reasoning Fields Work Universally

#### 1. **Explicit Chain-of-Thought**
- **Token-level guidance** improves optimization signal for ALL strategies
- **Intermediate steps** maintain consistency across approaches
- **Process externalization** better than implicit reasoning

#### 2. **Strategy-Specific Benefits**
- **Simple strategies** (Naive): Direct reasoning validation (+4.0%)
- **Complex strategies** (Contrastive CoT): Sophisticated reasoning patterns (+8.66%)
- **Iterative strategies** (Self-Refine): Multi-step reasoning chains (+2.0%)

#### 3. **Model Learning Enhancement**
- **DSPy bootstrap** learns from explicit reasoning traces
- **Pattern identification** clearer with reasoning examples
- **Error reduction** through step-by-step validation
