        "narrative": "Customer contacted Kia's Consumer Affairs (CA) Department on June [XXX], 2022 indicating that her husband was involved in an accident and the airbags in their 2022 Kia Telluride did not deploy.  Customer reported her husband was driving the subject Telluride at 65mph through a toll southbound on [XXX] when a second vehicle behind the Telluride went through the toll and attempted to squeeze in between the Telluride and a third vehicle on the highway. Customer's husband moved the Telluride to the right to evade the second vehicle and made contact with the right shoulder guardrail.  No other vehicles were involved in the incident.  The vehicle was towed.  When asked by CA, the customer reported that HDA and cruise control were engaged at the time of the incident but customer did not allege that either of those systems caused the accident.  \nThe subject Kia Telluride is equipped with the ADAS Level 2 feature Highway Driving Assist (HDA).  HDA is a supplemental system that helps maintain a set distance and speed from the vehicle ahead when driving on a highway and helps keep the vehicle between lanes while driving.  HDA may not be able to recognize all traffic situations and may not detect possible collisions due to limitations of the system.  Obstacles such as vehicles, motorcycles, bicycles, pedestrians, unspecified objects and structures that may collide with the vehicle may not be detected.  \nBased on the description of provided by the customer, the accident was not caused by a failure and\/or disengagement of HDA.  Kia has no further information at this time.\n***6\/[XXX]\/22 10-Day Update Incident Report***\nOn 6\/[XXX]\/22, Kia spoke with customer's husband regarding the incident. Customer's husband reiterated that his concern was that he believed the airbags should have deployed when he side-swiped the guardrails after he was \"cut-off\" by another vehicle.\n***7\/[XXX]\/22 Monthly Update Incident Report***\nSince Kia's updates on the 10-Day Update Incident Report, Kia has not received any material new, or materially different information related to this incident.",

        "narrative": "On August [XXX], 2022 Toyota received a field report related to this crash. The vehicle was reportedly traveling east on [XXX], when it approached a vehicle travelling the wrong way on the road operated by a drunk driver. The Toyota Corolla driver alleged that they attempted to swerve right to miss the oncoming vehicle, but collided with the vehicle on the driver side. As a result of the collision, the Toyota Corolla allegedly rolled over, landed on its wheels, and contacted a highway barrier. \nToyota obtained Vehicle Control History (VCH) and Event Data Recorder (EDR) data from the subject vehicle. VCH provides an approximately 8 second pre-crash data recording, and EDR provides an approximately 4.80 second pre-crash data recording. Based on the data obtained, the following information was observed:  Lane Trace Assist (LTA) was engaged during the recording until approximately 6.7 seconds prior to the crash event and Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC) was engaged during the recording until approximately 5.5 seconds prior to the crash event. ADAS L2 was disengaged approximately 6.7 seconds prior to the crash due to driver steering input exceeding the steering torque override threshold of LTA. The vehicle was traveling at approximately 89 MPH prior to the crash event. \nAs a result of the crash incident, the subject vehicle was towed away from the scene. Injuries to occupants of the subject vehicle were described by the owner as: Driver: Cerebral fluid leaking from nose, Concussion, whiplash, backpain Front Passenger: No injuries reported.\nThis report is a Monthly Update.

I wasn't sure if the cruise control was still on so I returned my foot to the accelerator and tried to get back into the right lane (so as not to hit the k-rail). I think I probably over corrected a bit and veered slightly into the left-hand lane but then I felt the car try to fully jerk us into that left lane. At that point, I lost control of the car as the back started fishtailing.\" The driver also noted that \"I am a petite person, with minimal upper body strength, so I had a really hard time trying to control the heft of the vehicle as it was trying to veer into different lanes\". According to the customer report the driver was taken to the hospital and diagnosed with a strained left shoulder and the other 2 occupants, both adults, were not injured.\nUpdate: On January [XXX], 2024, at 10:33:20 a.m. PST, the subject vehicle was traveling south on [XXX] at 77 mph with Rivians Level 2 ADAS feature, Highway Assist (HWA), engaged. 25 seconds later, at 10:33:45 a.m. the vehicle notified the driver through a message on the driver display that their lane was merging ahead. 19 seconds later, at 10:34:04 a.m. PST, after no intervention from the driver, HWA disengaged because the subject vehicle moved out of its ODD as a result of insufficient highway markings.  At that same time, 10:34:04 a.m., the driver received audio and visual alerts to take over control of the subject vehicle through in-vehicle messaging. At this time the system did not detect hands on the wheel. Less than one second later, at 10:34:05 a.m., the driver put their hands back on the wheel and retook control but input a significant steering angle while still at a high rate of speed (75.4 mph) that started a loss of control. This steering input was not a result of the HWA feature, but an overcorrection by the driver. Over the next nine seconds, from 10:34:05 to 10:34:14 a.m., the driver steered the vehicle to both the left and right trying to regain control, they also applied both the brake and accelerator pedals at various times, sometimes simultaneously, until the vehicle departed the roadway and impacted the side barrier at 10:34:14 a.m. PST, causing damage to the right side of the subject vehicle and deploying the side airbags.",

The incident reportedly took place at the intersection of [XXX] and [XXX] in Shelbyville, TN, both of which are not limited access highways. On July 31, 2024 Nissan determined that ProPilot Assist 1.0 was active (\"hands-on\" mode) within 30 seconds of the incident. Telematics data was last transmitted approximately 1,500 ft before the intersection. No crash notification was transmitted at the time of the incident.\nBased on information in the news report, on Monday July [XXX], 2024, the driver of the Ariya was traveling north on [XXX] approaching an intersection with [XXX]. A tractor-trailer that was reportedly traveling west from [XXX] pulled out in front of the Nissan Ariya. According to the report the Ariya traveled underneath the trailer and continued approximately 100 yards before coming to a stop. The driver and passenger of the Ariya reportedly sustained fatal injuries. The tractor-trailer driver was reported not injured.\nAccording to the police report, at approximately 6:15 p.m. on July [XXX], 2024, the Nissan Ariya was traveling north on [XXX] in the number two lane when a tractor trailer traveling west bound on [XXX] attempted to make a left-hand turn onto [XXX]South, traveling across the northbound lane. The police report states that the Nissan Ariya collided with the left rear side of the trailer and continued traveling north into the median.  According to the police report: the Ariya driver and passenger sustained fatal injuries and had to be extricated from the vehicle multiple airbags were deployed the passenger's seat belt use was \"improper\" the Ariya driver was belted and the tractor trailer driver was operating with a disqualified license.\nNissan obtained vehicle EDR from law enforcement. That data indicated that the speed at impact was 53.4 mph, with no pre-impact brake application. \nNissan conducted a preliminary, non-destructive inspection on August 6, 2024. The vehicle had been stored in the open air and uncovered until August 3, 2024.  Various components were stored by the junkyard in an unidentified location and made available for inspection.  The vehicles condition is consistent with underride of the tractor trailer and extrication. \nThe driver seatbelt was found buckled with the lap portion routed behind the seat, the pretensioner having activated and shoulder-belt webbing cut near the d-ring location. The passenger seatbelt was buckled, with both lap and shoulder belt pulled tight against the seat back, with the pretensioner having activated. \nNissan was able to collect the vehicles ADAS control unit and Lane Camera assembly. Nissan is currently assessing whether it is possible to extract data, to the extent it exists, from these items.  \nNissan conducted an inspection of the trailer on October 9th. No findings during the inspection changed our understanding of the incident.\nNissan is continuing to analyze information regarding this incident.",
